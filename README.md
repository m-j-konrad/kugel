KUGEL

is a little Android game written in Kotlin.
There's a green ball ("Kugel" in german) moved by acceleration sensor.
You have to catch other smaller green balls and avoid collisions with
the red ones coming into the game one atfer another.

Now it is possible to change the color of the enemy balls and the screen brightness.
The state is saved when the app is in the background and reloaded if the app comes back.

It's fun, I think!
I'm just learning and this is what I get out of Android using
Android Studio and Kotlin.
