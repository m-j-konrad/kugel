KUGEL

is a little Android game written with Kotlin.
There's a green ball ("Kugel" in German) moved by acceleration sensor.
You have to catch other smaler green balls and avoid collisions with
the red ones coming into the game one atfer another.

It's fun, I think!
I'm just learning and this is what I get out of Android using
Android Studio and Kotlin.
